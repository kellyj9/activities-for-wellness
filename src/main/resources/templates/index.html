        What is Wellness?
    </h6>
    <p class="p-justify">
        Wellness is more than a state of feeling well.
        Wellness is actively living a lifestyle that leads to optimal health and wellbeing.
        You can optimize your wellness despite the presence of illness or stress.
        With the concept of wellness, a person is seen from different dimensions
        to create a holistic perspective.

    <h6>
        What are the Dimensions of Wellness?
    </h6>
    <p>
        Through our activities, we can address our needs in different
        dimensions of wellness.
    <p>

    <div class="dimensions-heading">
        The dimensions of wellness include:
    </div>

    <div class="dimension-block">
        <th:block th:each="dimension_item : ${dimension}">
            <span
                    th:text="${dimension_item.name}"
                    class="dimension-block-item">
            </span>
        </th:block>
    </div>

    <p class="p-justify">
        Focusing too much or too little in one dimension can cause us to feel imbalanced.
        Our activities in one dimension can influence our wellness in other dimensions.
        In order to optimize our wellness, we pursue activities in all dimensions of
        wellness.
    </p>
    <p class="p-justify">
        Our activities for wellness can be planned according to factors such as our goals,
        beliefs, values, culture, personality, and life experiences.
    </p>
